TASKS PERFORMED : 
  1. API Integration and Data Visualization
This task involves writing a Python script to fetch real-time data from a public API, such as OpenWeatherMap. Using libraries like requests, data is collected, processed, and visualized with matplotlib or seaborn. The goal is to display the data clearly through visual elements like line charts or bar graphs. A visualization dashboard will help users interpret trends, such as weather patterns, over time.
2. Automated Report Generation
This script automates the creation of a structured report by reading and analyzing data from a file (e.g., CSV or Excel). Using libraries like FPDF or ReportLab, the script compiles a formatted PDF report with summaries, tables, and plots. The task demonstrates how Python can streamline documentation and reporting workflows in business or research environments.
3. AI Chatbot with NLP
In this task, a basic AI chatbot is developed using Natural Language Processing libraries like NLTK or spaCy. The bot is capable of understanding and responding to user inputs with relevant answers. It demonstrates how to tokenize input, recognize entities or intents, and generate meaningful replies. This project is ideal for understanding NLP fundamentals and building interactive applications.
4. Machine Learning Model Implementation
This task focuses on building a machine learning model using scikit-learn. The model could solve a classification problem, such as spam email detection, by training on labeled datasets. The deliverable is a Jupyter Notebook that includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix, and insights from the results. It showcases end-to-end ML workflow.
